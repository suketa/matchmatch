# matchmatch

matchmatch is shinkei-suijaku in Japanese.

I implemented this game to learn React. I'm a React beginner.

I was inspired the image of the following page, but, I had not read the article and the code
when I implemented this game.

And this game is not PWA.

## How to play

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Remark

### Environment

I checked the game works in Firefox 62.0.3 and Chrome 69.0.3497.100

### CSS

I used CSS grid, so, if the browser doesn't support CSS grid, then the game doesn't work well.

### Restriction

- There is no reset button. You must reload the page if you reset the game.
- There is no message even if the game cleared.
- The app is not PWA.
- The app is not responsive.
- The app has very poor GUI.
